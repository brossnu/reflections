	"diff" 

"diff" allowed me to see, via "+" and "-" the difference between 2 files
both new and old code were placed on top of each other
this made it easy to compare and contrast

	easy access to entire history of file
	makes me a more efficient programmer long term

allows me to see changes in progressions
allows me to revert to perhaps a better coding method
cut and paste more efficient code into lastest version
track progress and time spent

	Manual Commits vs. Automatic (google docs)
pros
	when is chosen by me
	logical changes selected by me
	easy grouping of changes
cons
	potential to have forget to save "why" change made
	too long a time between changes

	Multi-File Commits
some files are related to one other
allows you to see changes using git log --stat
treating each file seperately works but hard to sort 
	and see how changes affect mult files

	Confidence in making changes
Can revert to a previous commit to find bugs
This allows a "back-up" copy so I don't worry about 
	breaking something

	Want to try to use Git for
Saving versions of my new code!
